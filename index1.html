            My favorite restaurant is Chik-fil-A. I love Chik-fil-A for a handful of reasons. The first being that their chicken sandwiches are the bomb.com. One of the hard decisions in my life is walking into a Chik-fil-A and choosing between the original chicken sandwich and their chicken nuggets but a majority of the time it's the sandwich. I always wash it down with a red Hi-C and a side of waffle fries.

        <p id="paragraph2" class="even">
            Not only does Chik-fil-A have the best chicken sandwiches but they also have some of the friendliest staff out of any fast food restaurant I've been in. They always bring the food out to you and there's always a please and thank you. Not only that but it's right down the street to my apartment making this both easily accessible and always enjoyable.
